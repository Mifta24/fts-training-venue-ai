 * Gives the stage a sense of depth: the photo, the coordinator and the paper
 * panels drift by different amounts as the pointer moves, so she reads as
 * standing in front of the room rather than pasted on it.
 *
 * The pointer position is eased and published as --depth-x / --depth-y
 * (-1 to 1) on the stage; the layers read it in CSS. Only runs for a fine
 * pointer and when the guest has not asked for reduced motion.
